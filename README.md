# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.
Our purpose in this analysis was to extract total money spent on ride shares within the data set week on week.

## Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
![Summary of Fares per city type from Jan 2019 to April 2019](https://github.com/qklm/pyberanalysis/blob/main/PyBer_fare_summary.png)
* Late February to Early March was the high period across the board
* For urban cities the spike continued well into March
* Rural areas were unable to cross the $500 a week threshhold in this period.

## Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types
1. Focus on cultivating advertising leading up to late February, potentially with whoever caused this localized spike.
2. Though the driver density is substantially higher in Urban locations, drivers stand to make a lot more money per ride.
3. The variance in suburban areas is high, perhaps bringing more drivers from suburban locations to city locations will increase their take home on less busy weeks.
